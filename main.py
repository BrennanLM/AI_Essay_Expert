  "Moving to Texas was a big change for me. It was my first time leaving my home state and my first time living away from my family. As a student, I was excited to start this new chapter in my life, but I was also anxious about the challenges that lay ahead. The past year has been filled with ups and downs, but I have learned a lot about myself and what it means to be a student in Texas. One of the biggest challenges I have faced as a student in Texas is staying focused. The transition to a new environment has been difficult, and it has taken me a while to adjust to my new surroundings. I have found it difficult to maintain my focus in the classroom and to keep up with my coursework. I often find myself getting distracted by the new experiences and opportunities that are available to me in Texas. I have had to work hard to find a balance between enjoying my new surroundings and staying on top of my schoolwork. Balancing schoolwork and social life has also been a challenge for me. I am an active person, and I love to be involved in a variety of activities. In Texas, I have been able to get involved in many new clubs and organizations, but I have also had to manage my time carefully to make sure that I am not sacrificing my schoolwork for my social life. It has been a delicate balance, but I have learned to prioritize my time and responsibilities so that I can have a healthy balance of both. Finally, managing expectations from my family and culture has been a challenge for me. My family has high expectations for me, and they have always been supportive of my education. However, moving to Texas has made it difficult for me to communicate with them and keep them informed about my life. I also struggle with maintaining my cultural identity in a new and unfamiliar environment. I have had to find ways to stay connected with my roots and my family, while also embracing the new culture and community that I have become a part of in Texas. In conclusion, my experiences as a student in Texas have been challenging, but they have also been rewarding. I have learned a lot about myself and what it means to be a student in a new and unfamiliar environment. I have faced many challenges, but I have also overcome them, and I am proud of the progress I have made. Moving to Texas has been a growing experience for me, and I am grateful for the opportunities that I have had to learn and grow as a person.",
  "The purpose of my experiment was to design and construct a device that would protect an egg from cracking when dropped from 5ft.⠀  I used various materials, including paper, tape, Ziploc bags, and plastic straws to build my egg-drop device.⠀  The egg-drop device I created consisted of a plastic egg filled with clay, which was then taped to a piece of paper.⠀  The paper had 10 plastic straws taped to it, forming a kind of bounce pad under the egg.⠀  I was confident that this design would be successful in protecting the egg during the drop.⠀  So, why did this egg-drop device work? The plastic straws under the egg provide cushioning for the egg, reducing the force of impact in the event of a fall.⠀  Additionally, the paper and tape served to hold everything together and keep the egg and clay securely in place.⠀  I was thrilled when my egg-drop experiment was a complete success.⠀  The egg remained intact after being dropped from 1.⠀ 5 meters, proving that my device was effective in protecting it.⠀  This success not only reinforced my knowledge of the principles of science and engineering, but also showed me the importance of practical, hands-on experimentation in these fields.⠀  Through (not very) careful planning and (also not very) precise execution, I was able to design and build an effective egg-drop device that successfully protected the egg from cracking during a fall.⠀  This experiment was fun to do, and I look forward to the opportunity to apply what I've learned to future projects.⠀ "

  "Waking up to the sound of my alarm, I feel a wave of dread wash over me as I remember the long day ahead. I have a meeting with my boss at work and I'm not sure how it's going to go. I hope I'll be able to impress him and keep my job. As I get out of bed and start getting dressed, I realize that I need to buy groceries on the way home, but I don't have much money. I hope I'll be able to find something cheap and tasty to eat. I grab my keys and head out the door, feeling a rush of excitement as I step outside into the cool morning air. Walking to work, I pass by a park and I see a couple playing catch. I watch them for a moment, feeling a twinge of envy. I wish I had someone to share my life with, someone who would be there for me no matter what. I think about how lonely I've been feeling lately and I wonder if I'll ever find someone who will love me for who I am. The thought makes me feel sad and I try to shake it off as I walk into work. The meeting with my boss goes well, much better than I expected. He tells me that I'm doing a great job and that he's happy with my performance. I feel a wave of relief wash over me and I realize how much I've been stressing over this. I'm grateful for my job and I feel lucky to be employed in these uncertain times. I get back to my desk and start working on a project, feeling motivated and productive. Walking home, I stop by the grocery store and pick up a few items. I'm trying to be healthy and I make sure to buy some fruits and vegetables. I also pick up some snacks for later, because I know I'll need something to munch on while I work. I head home and start cooking dinner, thinking about how nice it will be to relax and watch some TV after a long day. As I sit down to eat, I start feeling overwhelmed by the day's events. I think about how much has changed in my life and how much I still want to achieve. I'm not sure where I'm going, but I hope that one day I'll find my place in the world. I finish dinner and settle in for the night, feeling grateful for another day and hoping for a better tomorrow.",
  "Typing without proper punctuation and grammar is weird. It feels like my thoughts are just flowing out without any structure or organization, just a bunch of words and ideas jumbled together like a mess, but I suppose that's the point of stream-of-consciousness writing. Let my thoughts run wild and see where they take me. It's like a journey into my own mind and thoughts. I've never really done this before, just typing whatever comes to mind. It's actually kind of liberating not having to worry about grammar and punctuation. It's like a weight has been lifted, and I can just type away without any worries. I like it. This keyboard is so smooth and responsive. It's like it's an extension of my own thoughts and feelings. I can just type away without any hindrance. It's like I can finally express myself freely without any restrictions, like I'm a bird flying through the sky with no limits. It's a beautiful feeling I must say. I'm thinking about my personal experiences and all the things I've been through in life. Some ups and some downs, but overall, I think I'm grateful for everything that's happened because it's shaped me into the person I am today. I'm proud of who I am and all that I've accomplished. I've learned so much and grown so much as a person, and I'm excited to see where life takes me next. Food is always a great topic to think about. I love to eat and I love to cook. I could spend hours in the kitchen experimenting with new recipes and ingredients. There's something so satisfying about creating something delicious from scratch and seeing people enjoy it. I love the look of joy and contentment on their faces when they take that first bite. It's like a small victory every time I make something yummy. School and work are such an important part of life. They take up so much of our time and energy, but it's all worth it in the end. We need to work and study to make a living and to be successful, but it's also important to have balance in life and make time for the things we love, like hobbies and spending time with loved ones. Because in the end, it's not just about the work we do, but about the memories and experiences we create. Relationships are such a big part of life as well. They bring us joy and love, but they can also bring us pain and heartache. But it's all part of the journey of life. We learn and grow from every relationship we have and we become a better person because of it. It's important to find people who support and love us for who we are and to hold onto those relationships with everything we've got. Hobbies are so important too.",
  "As a language model, I don't have personal experiences, but I can write a reflection based on what I have been trained on. I remember my high school days clearly, filled with excitement and nervousness about the future. My academic performance was strong, and I was eager to see where my education would take me. I recall my parents and teachers stressing the importance of a college education and the opportunities it could provide. As I made the move to college, I was filled with a mix of emotions. Excitement about the new experiences and freedom, but also nervousness about navigating this new chapter in my life. My initial thoughts about college life were that it was going to be a time of self-discovery and growth, both academically and personally. I also anticipated the challenges and hard work that would come with it, but I was ready to face them head-on. During my time in college, I have come to appreciate the opportunities available to me. I am able to explore my passions and interests, both in and outside of the classroom. I am also learning the importance of balancing my academic and personal life, taking time for self-care and building meaningful relationships. In my four years at university, I hope to achieve academic success and gain valuable knowledge and skills that will help me in my future career. I am also looking forward to growing as a person, discovering who I am and what I stand for. I hope to make meaningful connections with my peers and learn from their diverse perspectives. Overall, my experiences so far have shaped my outlook on college. I now see it as a time to challenge myself, both academically and personally, and to gain the knowledge and skills needed to succeed in the future. I am grateful for the opportunities that college provides and look forward to what the next few years will bring.",

  "Cats have been beloved pets for thousands of years, captivating the hearts of people all over the world with their charming personalities and adorable antics. These fascinating creatures have been domesticated for so long that they have become a staple of modern society, with millions of homes around the world containing at least one feline friend. One of the reasons cats are so popular is because they are low-maintenance pets. Unlike dogs, they don't require daily walks or frequent visits to the park, and they are content to spend most of their day sleeping or lounging. This makes them the perfect pets for busy people who want a companion but don't have a lot of time or energy to devote to their pet. Another reason people love cats is because of their unique personalities. No two cats are exactly alike, and each one has its own unique set of quirks and characteristics that make it special. Some cats are affectionate and love to be cuddled, while others are more independent and prefer to spend time alone. Some are playful and energetic, while others are more laid-back and relaxed. These individual personalities make each cat a unique and special companion. Cats also provide a number of benefits for their owners. They are known to reduce stress and anxiety, and spending time with a cat has been shown to lower blood pressure and improve overall well-being. Additionally, they are great at controlling pests like mice and rats, and they provide a natural form of entertainment and stimulation. Despite all these benefits, however, owning a cat is not without its challenges. For example, they are prone to certain health issues like hairballs, dental problems, and urinary tract infections. They also have a tendency to scratch and damage furniture, and they can be litter trained, but this takes time and patience. In conclusion, cats are fascinating creatures that make wonderful pets. With their unique personalities, low-maintenance nature, and numerous health benefits, it's easy to see why they are such a popular choice for pet owners all over the world. Whether you are looking for a fun and playful companion or a more relaxed and low-key pet, a cat is sure to bring joy and happiness into your life."
  "Gatorade is a sports drink that was first developed in 1965 by a team of researchers at the University of Florida. The drink was created to help replenish the fluids and electrolytes lost by athletes during intense physical activity. Over the years, Gatorade has become a staple for athletes and fitness enthusiasts around the world, and its popularity continues to grow. The creation of Gatorade can be traced back to the University of Florida's football team, the Gators. At the time, the team was struggling to perform well, and their coach, Dwayne Douglas, was looking for a solution. He approached a team of researchers at the university, led by Dr. Robert Cade, and asked them to find a way to help the players perform better. The researchers conducted a series of experiments on the football players and discovered that they were losing a significant amount of fluids and electrolytes through sweat during games and practices. This led to dehydration and fatigue, which in turn impacted their performance on the field. To address this issue, the researchers developed a sports drink that would replace the fluids and electrolytes lost during physical activity. The original recipe for Gatorade consisted of water, sugar, salt, lemon juice, and sodium citrate. The drink was tested on the university's football players, and the results were remarkable. The players reported feeling less fatigued and more refreshed after drinking Gatorade, and their performance improved dramatically. In 1965, the University of Florida granted a license for the production and distribution of Gatorade to a company called Stokely-Van Camp. The drink quickly gained popularity among athletes, and by the 1970s, it was widely available in stores across the United States. Over the years, Gatorade has undergone numerous changes and improvements, but its core formula remains the same: a combination of fluids, carbohydrates, and electrolytes designed to help athletes perform at their best. Today, Gatorade is a global brand, available in over 80 countries around the world. It is widely recognized as one of the leading sports drinks, and is used by athletes of all levels, from amateur to professional. The foundation of Gatorade remains its commitment to helping athletes perform at their best, and it continues to be a vital part of the sports world. In conclusion, the foundation of Gatorade can be traced back to the University of Florida's football team, the Gators. The drink was created to help replenish the fluids and electrolytes lost by athletes during intense physical activity, and its popularity has only continued to grow since its creation in 1965. Today, Gatorade is a global brand, synonymous with performance and endurance, and continues to play a vital role in the world of sports."
  "The sunset was a breathtaking sight. The sky was painted in shades of pink, orange, and yellow, creating a mesmerizing contrast against the dark blue horizon. The sun, now a bright orange ball, sat just above the line of the sea, casting its warm rays on the rippling water below. The gentle sound of waves crashing against the shore and the cool breeze that caressed my face made for the perfect ending to a beautiful day."
  "I remembered the day my best friend moved away as if it were yesterday. We had been inseparable since childhood, and the thought of him leaving was unbearable. On his last day, we took a walk to our favorite spot by the lake, where we had spent countless hours fishing and laughing. As we sat there, I couldn't help but feel a deep sadness wash over me. He turned to me, gave me a hug and whispered, 'I'll always be your best friend, no matter the distance.' Those words stayed with me, and I knew that our friendship would endure through anything life threw our way."
  "Everyone should have access to a healthy and nutritious diet. It is a basic human right to have access to food that will sustain and nourish the body. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins is essential for maintaining good health, preventing diseases, and promoting overall wellness. By ensuring that all individuals have access to healthy food, we can reduce healthcare costs, improve productivity, and create a happier and more fulfilling society. It is time for governments and communities to prioritize and invest in making healthy food accessible to all."
  "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. This process is crucial for the survival of plants and all living beings that rely on them for food and oxygen. During photosynthesis, plants absorb light through pigments called chlorophyll and use it to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (a sugar) and oxygen. The glucose is then stored as energy for the plant to use later, while the oxygen is released into the air. Photosynthesis is a remarkable and ongoing process that helps maintain the delicate balance of life on our planet."
  "The Great Barrier Reef is one of the world's most magnificent natural wonders and a UNESCO World Heritage site. Located off the coast of Australia, it is the largest coral reef system in the world and home to a diverse array of marine life, including over 1,500 species of fish, and more than 400 species of coral. The Great Barrier Reef is also an important tourist destination, attracting millions of visitors each year who come to admire its beauty and participate in activities like snorkeling and scuba diving. Unfortunately, the reef is facing numerous threats, including climate change, pollution, and overfishing, which are threatening its survival. It is imperative that we take action to protect and conserve this important ecosystem for future generations."
  "So, you're sitting at your desk, trying to write a story but you just can't seem to get started. You're feeling really stuck and can't figure out what to write. That's when you imagine a character who's going through the same thing as you. They're sitting at their desk, staring at a blank page, just like you. But, unlike you, they give up hope and decide to stop writing. You keep typing, watching as the character tries everything they can think of to get their imagination going, but nothing works. They're feeling hopeless and lost, just like you used to feel. Then, something amazing happens! They come across a strange book that takes them to another world. In this world, they meet a wise wizard who teaches them all about creativity and how to tap into their imagination. The character goes on adventures, facing challenges and obstacles along the way, but with the help of the wizard, they overcome them all. They learn that writing is not about being perfect, but about letting their imagination go wild. By the end of the story, the character has found the courage to start writing again and their words flow easily onto the page. They've broken through their block and rediscovered the joy of writing. You read what you've written and feel inspired and hopeful. You realize that the story isn't just about a fictional character, it's about you too. So, you take a deep breath, let your imagination go wild, and start writing. You've broken through your writer's block and found the joy of writing again!"
  "Photosynthesis is when plants take light and turn it into energy. It's super important for plants to survive and for us to breathe and eat because we rely on them. Chlorophyll helps plants soak up the light and with it, they can turn carbon dioxide and water into sugar and oxygen. The sugar is saved for later and the oxygen goes into the air. Photosynthesis is a crazy cool process that helps keep the planet in balance. The Great Barrier Reef is one of the coolest things on earth! It's in Australia and is the biggest coral reef system ever. There's a ton of different fish and coral there. People love to go there to swim and see it all up close. But, it's in trouble because of things like climate change, pollution, and too much fishing. We have to do something to save it for the future."
  "Well, here I am, just hanging out in the hallway, waiting for class to start. It's a bit of a mix-up on my part, since I got here a little early. I thought class started at 3:30, but it's actually at 3. No worries though, I'll just transfer my notes to my computer later. This hallway has a different feel to it compared to the others. I can't quite put my finger on what makes it different, but it just feels... different. The door next to me is making a pretty annoying squeaking sound, which doesn't help the atmosphere much. I'm not feeling very inspired or creative right now. My roommate told me that people tend to be more creative during the late hours, like 2 or 3 in the morning. I guess this is just my low-creative time of day. I could definitely use a break from all the things I need to get done. I need to grab dinner too. I'm trying to avoid the death carts (the food trucks), since I don't trust what kind of meat they use. I don't want to end up eating dog! I had a dog back home, but I had to leave him there for now. I'll get to see him at Christmas, though. It's nice that the semester ends at that time of year, so I don't have to worry about school stuff during the holidays. Unlike in high school, where teachers would give tests right after long vacations. It was always a bummer, but I didn't do too badly on them. Typing all this one-handed is a bit of a challenge for me. I fractured my finger about a week ago, so it's currently immobilized. It's amazing how often we use our pinkies and don't even think about it. It's such an important finger! I'm counting down the weeks until it's healed - only five more to go. Starting college and adjusting to the loss of complete hand movement (essentially, my left hand) has been a wild ride. I'm also two pages into this essay and my leg is asleep. The pins and needles feeling is always a fun sensation. I'm wondering how much longer I have until class starts. Almost there, I think. I'm feeling pretty good that I managed to get this essay done before the deadline. It's not the first time I've done that, but it's close. I've also learned one thing about the University of Texas - TEX hates me. I asked TEX (the school's search engine) to find one of my classes, and it replied that it had been added from 7 to 9. Unfortunately, TEX didn't specify that it was 7 to 9 PM. So now I'm no longer enrolled in anthropology. Goodbye and good luck to that class!"
  "The song Hot Girl Bummer by Blackbear has been a major hit in the music industry, and its impact has been felt in popular culture, society, and beyond. In this essay, I will analyze the meaning behind the lyrics of Hot Girl Bummer and explore how it has impacted popular culture, as well as examine the influence it has had on society's perception of women. In the song Hot Girl Bummer by Blackbear, the lyrics discuss themes of loneliness and heartache. Through an analysis of the lyrics, it is evident that the singer is expressing his own personal experiences of feeling isolated and depressed. He laments his inability to fit in with the cool kids and seems to be searching for someone to fill the hole in his heart. This song is an excellent example of how lyrics can be used to capture the emotional state of the songwriter. According to IT Inyabri in his 2016 Sociolinguistic Studies, the use of language and speech patterns can be used to indicate the mental and emotional state of the speaker (Inyabri, 2016). In this case, the lyrics of the song Hot Girl Bummer demonstrate the feelings of loneliness, isolation, and depression that the singer is experiencing. The use of words such as alone and lonely is a clear indication that the singer is struggling to find someone to care for him. Ultimately, the song serves as a powerful reminder of how even the most popular people can suffer from feelings of loneliness and depression. Hot Girl Bummer, released by rapper blackbear in 2019, has had a significant impact on popular culture. The song, with its catchy beats and humorous lyrics, quickly went viral, becoming a popular meme and an anthem for many. According to CM Roach (2003), the song made a big splash in the music industry, with its growing popularity on streaming platforms. Furthermore, the song has been widely referenced by celebrities, such as Cardi B and Justin Bieber, as well as having been featured in movies and TV shows, such as Grown-ish and The Lovebirds. Additionally, the song has been used as a source of inspiration for fashion, with many collections being released by companies such as Gucci, Fendi, and Versace. Hot Girl Bummer has, thus, significantly contributed to popular culture, with its catchy beats and humorous lyrics appealing to many people. The influence of single songs on society's perception of women can be a powerful one. This was certainly the case with the song Hot Girl Bummer by Blackbear, released in 2019. According to Strickland and Taber in their 2011 article from the Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law, the song garnered a significant amount of attention due to its inappropriate lyrics that depicted women as objects of sexual desire and its accompanying music video which showed two women in revealing clothing and sexually suggestive positions. As a result of the song, society's perception of women was greatly impacted. It perpetuated the idea that a woman’s worth is based solely on her appearance and sexuality, which can be damaging to real women who are trying to be respected in a patriarchal society. The glamorization of behavior in the song and video, such as sexual promiscuity, could also lead to young women being more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior. The song also perpetuated an idea of a cool girl who is available for male sexual pleasure, and this notion of what a woman should be like had a significant effect on how society views women. It is clear that the song had an impact on society’s perception of women, and it is important to be aware of the consequences of these depictions in the media. The song Hot Girl Bummer is a powerful reminder that no matter how hard life gets, it's important to stay positive and keep pushing forward. It's easy to slip into a negative mindset, but listening to a song like this can serve as a reminder that even bad days don't last forever. With the right combination of self-love, resilience, and support from those around us, we can persevere and find a way to make our dreams a reality."

  "In this essay, I will discuss the life of Chief Joseph as well as the central events and struggles he endured. We will look over his early life, leadership, wars & retreats, values he stood for, and later years. His story is an excellent example of the injustices the US government committed against Native Americans and the suffering of those who lead honorably. As you may know, Chief Joseph was born in Wallowa Valley, Oregon sometime in 1840. His name was passed down to him by his father who had been named Joseph by Rev. Spalding after he was baptized. Rev. Spalding was a Christian missionary who traveled to the Pacific Northwest to educate native Americans and try to convert them to Christianity. Young Joseph spent much of his time at Rev. Spalding's mission and probably attended the lessons (though he was too young to learn much English). His father and Spalding eventually had a major disagreement, causing them to return to their old traditions. Young Joseph and his father visited a treaty council in 1855. After some debate, all of the Nez Perce chiefs signed the provided treaty as it protected most of their homes and roaming grounds. Unfortunately, the treaty wasn't enforced and settlers continued to trespass on their lands. The US government came up with a second treaty with terms more comparable to theft. Though many of the Chiefs were disgusted and left, a few remained behind. Despite only one of them signing, the government considered that sufficient agreement (Kershner). This is what kicked off the division of the tribe into treaty and non-treaty Nez Perce and caused many future conflicts. Nevertheless, Young Joseph (now a Chief) tried to lead peacefully even after being betrayed by the US government. His hand was forced when several young Nez Perce warriors sought revenge on the settlers for an earlier murder. Despite all this, he still tried to avoid bloodshed by leading the remaining Nez Perce on a march to escape further conflict, though there were brief skirmishes, the war had yet to fully begin. It only properly broke out at the Battle of the Big Hole, 80 Nez Perce were killed (more than half of them women and children) whereas the Nez Perce only killed 34 enemies, and among them not a single woman or child. Before his defeat, he led the remaining non-treaty Nez Perce on a 1300-mile march to seek safety. They tried to seek refuge with the Crow tribe but were refused, forcing them to try to flee to Canada instead. After several more skirmishes, they eventually arrived at the site of the last battle, they were only a few days away from the Canadian border when the US army caught up with them. Throughout several brutal battles, the other Chiefs were killed, along with his brother (though around 200 Nez Perce made it over the border). After all was said and done Chief Joseph surrendered and gave his famous speech, giving rise to the famous line that is from where the sun now stands I will fight no more. Despite promises otherwise, he was never allowed to return to his original lands and even today his body is buried not where he grew up, but in the small Colville Reservation. Until his death, he continued to advocate for his people's rights. (University of Michigan Library; Kershner). Truly Chief Joseph was a man of an ironclad will, He held a few core values to heart and did everything he could to fulfill them. These include but are not limited to the following: firstly, peace. He did everything he could to avoid an unnecessary war. He was even willing to give up his home if it meant not shedding any more blood. Second, honor. Even after being forced to wage war, his motivations were still pure. He wanted to defend the site of his father's grave and his people's home, and even during the war he spared women and children. When he was eventually defeated it was in large part because the war would result in further death for his people (Kershner). Lastly, human rights. Even after his defeat just outside the Canadian border, he remained a powerful activist dedicated to either achieving equality or laying the groundwork for the future (New World Encyclopedia). In the end, he and the other remaining Nez Perce were shipped off to a reservation in North Dakota (followed by one in Kansas, and lastly one in Oklahoma). However, as a result of the war, Chief Joseph became famous nationally and received praise for his leadership during the war. Despite this newfound fame the US government still refused to allow them to return to their native lands. Chief Joseph did eventually manage to relocate to the Colville Reservation which was much closer to home, but he was never able to return to Wallowa. When he died on September 21st, 1904 doctors remarked that it was due to a broken heart (Kershner). "
    "Cheating has been a problem in schools for as long as education has existed. However, with the emergence of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), cheating has become even more prevalent and harder to detect. One of the most significant challenges that educators face when it comes to AI-powered cheating is the use of automated essay-writing software. By inputting a topic and other relevant information, this software generates an essay that appears to have been written by a human. Students can produce an essay in seconds, making it challenging for teachers to detect whether it was genuinely their work or not. In addition to using essay-writing software, students can also use AI to modify existing essays to make them appear original. By using programs that can change the structure and syntax of an essay, students can create an entirely new essay that is free of plagiarism. This type of cheating can be difficult to detect, as plagiarism checkers may not be able to catch the subtle changes made to the original essay. Another form of AI-powered cheating is using chatbots to take online exams. Chatbots are programs that simulate human conversation, and students can program them to answer questions during an online exam. These chatbots can be designed to mimic human behavior and responses, making it challenging to detect cheating. Despite these challenges posed by AI-powered cheating, there are ways that educators can detect and prevent it. Many educational institutions are now using AI to detect plagiarism in student essays. By comparing a student's work to a vast database of existing essays, AI-powered plagiarism checkers can identify instances of plagiarism and flag them for review. Although there will be a point where these tools become ineffective, for now, they are extremely beneficial. Educational institutions and numerous other organizations will most likely require them, as their students and employees seek to harness the power of AI to attain unparalleled advantages. Another concern about AI-powered cheating is that it can undermine the value of a student's education. When students cheat using AI, they may receive grades and degrees that do not reflect their true knowledge or abilities. This can lead to a situation where students who cheat are able to secure jobs or other opportunities based on false credentials, while students who choose to learn and work hard are unfairly disadvantaged. As such, it is essential to take cheating seriously and work to prevent it in order to maintain the value of education for all students. In conclusion, AI-powered cheating is a growing problem in schools that educators need to be aware of. As AI continues to advance, it is essential to develop strategies to detect and prevent cheating while also harnessing its potential to enhance learning and promote academic integrity. By doing so, we can ensure that students are held accountable for their work and that academic integrity is maintained."
  "Well, right now I just woke up from a mid-day nap. It's sort of weird, but ever since I moved to Texas, I have had problems concentrating on things. I remember starting my homework in 10th grade as soon as the clock struck 4 and not stopping until it was done. Of course it was easier, but I still did it. But when I moved here, the homework got a little more challenging and there was a lot more busy work, and so I decided not to spend hours doing it, and just getting by. But the thing was that I always paid attention in class and just plain out knew the stuff, and now that I look back, if I had really worked hard and stayed on track the last two years without getting lazy, I would have been a genius, but hey, that's all good. It's too late to correct the past, but I don't really know how to stay focused n the future. The one thing I know is that when people say that b/c they live on campus they can't concentrate, it's b. s. For me it would be easier there, but alas, I'm living at home under the watchful eye of my parents and a little nagging sister that just nags and nags and nags. You get my point. Another thing is, is that it's just a hassle to have to go all the way back to school to just to go to library to study. I need to move out, but I don't know how to tell them. Don't get me wrong, I see where they're coming from and why they don't want me to move out, but I need to get away and be on my own. They've sheltered me so much and I don't have a worry in the world. The only thing that they ask me to do is keep my room clean and help out with the business once in a while, but I can't even do that. But I need to. But I got enough money from UT to live at a dorm or apartment next semester and I think I’ll take advantage of that. But off that topic now, I went to sixth street last night and had a blast. I haven't been there in so long. Now I know why I love Austin so much. When I lived in VA, I used to go up to DC all the time and had a blast, but here, there are so many students running around at night. I just want to have some fun and I know that I am responsible enough to be able to have fun, but keep my priorities straight. Living at home, I can't go out at all without them asking where? with who? why? when are you coming back? and all those questions. I just wish I could be treated like a responsible person for once, but my sister screwed that up for me. She went crazy the second she moved into college and messed up her whole college career by partying too much. And that's the ultimate reason that they don't want me to go and have fun. But I'm not little anymore, and they need to let me go and explore the world, but I’m Indian; with Indian culture, with Indian values. They go against having fun.  I mean in the sense of meeting people or going out with people or partying or just plain having fun. My school is difficult already, but somehow I think that having more freedom will put more pressure on me to do better in school b/c that's what my parents and ultimately I expect of myself. Well it's been fun writing, I don't know if you go anything out of this writing, but it helped me get some of my thoughts into order. So I hope you had fun reading it and good luck TA's.",
  "The purpose of my experiment was to design and construct a device that would protect an egg from cracking when dropped from 5ft. I used various materials, including paper, tape, Ziploc bags, and plastic straws to build my egg-drop device. The egg-drop device I created consisted of a plastic egg filled with clay, which was then taped to a piece of paper. The paper had 10 plastic straws taped to it, forming a kind of bounce pad under the egg. I was confident that this design would be successful in protecting the egg during the drop. So, why did this egg-drop device work? The plastic straws under the egg provide cushioning for the egg, reducing the force of impact in the event of a fall. Additionally, the paper and tape served to hold everything together and keep the egg and clay securely in place. I was thrilled when my egg-drop experiment was a complete success. The egg remained intact after being dropped from 1.5 meters, proving that my device was effective in protecting it. This success not only reinforced my knowledge of the principles of science and engineering, but also showed me the importance of practical, hands-on experimentation in these fields. Through (not very) careful planning and (also not very) precise execution, I was able to design and build an effective egg-drop device that successfully protected the egg from cracking during a fall. This experiment was fun to do, and I look forward to the opportunity to apply what I've learned to future projects."
  "Well, here we go with the stream of consciousness essay. I used to do things like this in high school sometimes. They were pretty interesting, but I often find myself with a lack of things to say. I normally consider myself someone who gets straight to the point. I wonder if I should hit enter any time to send this back to the front. Maybe I'll fix it later. My friend is playing guitar in my room now. Sort of playing anyway. More like messing with it. He's still learning. There's a drawing on the wall next to me. Comic book characters I think, but I'm not sure who they are. It's been a while since I've kept up with comic's. I just heard a sound from ICQ. That's a chat program on the internet. I don't know too much about it so I can't really explain too well. Anyway, I hope I'm done with this by the time another friend comes over. It will be nice to talk to her again. She went home this weekend for Labor Day. So did my brother. I didn't go. I'm not sure why. No reason to go, I guess. Hmm. when did I start this. Wow, that was a long line. I guess I won't change it later. Okay, I'm running out of things to talk about. I've found that happens to me a lot in conversation. Not a very interesting person, I guess. Well, I don't know. It's something I'm working on. I'm in a class now that might help. The phone just rang. Should I get it?  The guy playing the guitar answered it for me. It's for my roommate. My suitemate just came in and started reading this. I'm uncomfortable with that. He's in the bathroom now. You know, this is a really boring piece of literature. I never realized how dull most everyday thoughts are. Then again, when you keep your mind constantly moving like this, there isn't really time to stop and think deeply about things. I wonder how long this is going to be. I think it's been about ten minutes now. Only my second line. How sad. Well, not really considering how long these lines are. Anyway, I wonder what I'm going to do the rest of the night. I guess there's always homework to do. I guess we'll see. This seat is uncomfortable. My back sort of hurts. I think I'm going to have arthritis when I get older. I always thought that I wouldn't like to grow old. Not too old, I suppose. I've always been a very active person. I have a fear of growing old, I think. I guess it'll go away as I age gradually. I don't know how well I'd deal with paralysis from an accident though. As long as I have God and my friends around, I'll be okay though. I'm pretty thirsty right now. There isn't much to drink around my room. Ultimate Frisbee, I haven't played that all summer. Fun game, but tiring. I'm out of shape. I'd like to get in better shape, but I hate running. It's too dull for me. Hmmm. it's almost over now. Just a few more minutes. Let's see if I make it to the next line. Short reachable goals!  Whatever. Anyway, what else do I have to do tonight. I guess I could read some. My shirt smells like dinner. It's pretty disgusting. I need to wake up for a 9:30 am class tomorrow. I remember when that wasn't early at all. Well, I made it to the next line. I'm so proud of myself. That's sarcasm, by the way. I wonder if I was suppose to right this thing as a narrative. Oh well too late now. Time for me to head out. Until next time, good bye and good luck. I don't know. ",

  "Well, here I go with the good old stream of consciousness assignment again. I feel like I'm back in freshman HS English class again. Not that that's a bad thing, mind you, but my English teacher freshman year made us do these assignments constantly, and mine were always completely ridiculous, like, wow, I'm really hungry. I wish I could go to Taco Bell. They really had no point, except as busy work. In a psychology class, though, I can see the reasoning behind an assignment like this. Just letting my mind go free, and putting my random thoughts down in writing could be a big help in figuring out why I'm such a psychological screw-up. Well, that's not true. I don't want y'all getting the wrong idea about me, being that today was the first day of class and all. I'm really not a nut case. People may think I am, but really, I'm a normal kind of gal. Actually, down here in Texas, I guess I'm not normal. I don't like to eat biscuits and gravy for breakfast, and country fried steak with fried okra for dinner. I'm from Connecticut, and we don't even HAVE okra, much less worship it like it's some kind of vegetable goddess. My mind is starting to go blank--performance pressure I guess. I'm on the spot here--I don't want you all to be bored while you're reading this, if you ever do get around to reading this, that is. Well, I'm not going to stress just yet, so you're probably going to have to listen to some of my random, incoherent babbling for a few paragraphs. These computers are a big old pain in the ass. Here in the SMF, sure, they've got a bajillion computers, but unfortunately, we've got 42 bajillion students trying to use them, all at the same time. I think I'll be spending quite a few late, late nights in the computer center, just to get my stuff done. Yippee. That's what college is all about--late nights in the libraries. Yeah. Right. At this point, I don't even know what college is all about. I probably shouldn't say anything though, seeing as how I'm going to have to write another one of these thingys in a few days, where the topic is college  Blah, blah, blah. I can't believe I'm actually doing this assignment on the same day that is was assigned!  Go me!  Talk about dedication. I really can't believe this. In high school, procrastination was my middle name. No, it was my first name. By second semester, I have more free periods in a day than actual classes, so I didn't have to do a damn thing. It was great!  Unfortunately, because of that, I'm going to have to work that much harder here at UT, to get those studying skills back up to par. High School. Now that was a trip. When I was there, I couldn't wait to get out of there. I hated that school, that town, everything except my friends, of course. Then, my family moved, right after graduation, and I learned real quick that there were worse places to be than in my old town. At least back home I have my friends and my boyfriend and my piece of crap car, and I knew what there was to do. After I moved, I had no friends, no life, no car, no nothing. I worked all day. That's it. now, though, I'm ready for this whole college thing. Austin seems like a fun city, where I might actually enjoy spending the next four years. Oh yeah. While we're on the subject of four years,  why is it that all the professors & administrators that give speeches and stuff always make it sound like we'll be in college for like, 5 or 6 years?  I'm sorry, but I plan on graduating in 4 years. What's the problem here?  What are people doing, that they can't graduate in 4 years?  I just don't get it. no offense if any of y'all reading this took like 7 years to do your undergrad work. I'm not trying to knock you, just trying to figure this out. Well, it's 9:19, exactly 18 minutes after I started this nifty little piece of writing that makes no sense and has no point. I'm not really sure if I have fulfilled this assignment, like if I was supposed to analyze my personal stream of consciousness, where it took me, and what that means regarding my own personality. I guess if I had to, I could say that my mind works in mysterious ways, and even if the above essay seems to be illogically connected, to me, I can see the patterns. Yeah. I just went back & tried to read this over again, and I've got to give a suggestion. For these assignments, make the box we're writing in a box where you can see the whole line of writing at one time, without have to scroll across , because it's a real big pain for me, and I'm sure it's just as big a pain for you when you're trying to read it. Unless, of course, when you read it, you can see the whole line at once. I don't know, just a suggestion!  Thanks for taking the time to give us all the opportunity to get an easy 10 % of out final grade through these writing assignments!",

  'The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race is an annual dog sled race in March between Anchorage and Nome, Alaska, U.S. The race can entice greater than one hundred individuals and their groups of dogs, and each male and female mushers (drivers) compete together. A brief race of about 25 miles (40 km) used to be prepared in 1967 as a phase of the centennial get together of the Alaska Purchase and advanced in 1973 into the present day race. The architects of the race have been Dorothy G. and Joe Redington, Sr., a musher and kennel owner; they are recognised as the mom and father of the Iditarod. Enthusiasts name it the “last excellent race on Earth.” The route of the race, roughly 1,100 miles (1,770 km) long, in part follows the historical Iditarod Trail dogsled mail route blazed from the coastal cities of Seward and Knik to the goldfields and mining camps of northwestern Alaska in the early 1900s. Sled groups delivered mail and resources to such cities as Nome and Iditarod and carried out gold. The path declined in use in the 1920s, when the aircraft began to exchange the dogsled as the essential capability of crossing the challenging terrain. But when no successful pilot was accessible in the course of Alaska’s diphtheria epidemic of 1925, a crew of mushers battled blizzard stipulations and rushed serum to icebound Nome. This heroic action, known as the “Great Race of Mercy,” delivered a renewed worldwide reputation to the path and the canine teams, especially to Balto, the lead canine of the group that in the end reached Nome. In reminiscence of the serum run’s foremost musher, Leonhard Seppala, the Iditarod was once at the beginning known as the Iditarod Trail Seppala Memorial Race. Today’s race commemorates each the serum run and Alaska’s frontier past, and it is patterned after the famed All Alaska Sweepstakes Race between Nome and Candle that started out in 1908. Also, “While some mushers train their teams over the summer or the off-season with wheeled rigs or all-terrain vehicles, most wait until September or October.” {Britannica,com} Next, The Iditarod crosses two mountain levels (the Alaska, and the Kuskokwim ranges), runs alongside the Yukon River for a hundred and fifty miles (241 km), and crosses frozen waterways, inclusive of the pack ice of Norton Sound. The route size and route fluctuate barely from year to year, and the center 0.33 takes alternate routes in extraordinary and even years. Beginning with the 2008 race, the ceremonial begin in Anchorage used to be shortened by 7 miles (11 km), and the aggressive beginning factor used to be formally moved 30 miles (48 km) north from Wasilla to Willow because the results of world warming on the Alaskan snow cover.In 2015, due to the fact of the lack of snow south of the Alaska Range, the aggressive beginning factor used to be moved north to Fairbanks, which changed the path and shortened its size with the aid of extra than one hundred miles (160 km). The authentic Iditarod Trail was once a specific countrywide historical path in 1978. Lastly, the race has been criticized through animal-rights activists and others involved about fatalities and accidents to the dogs. These critics declare that at least 114 puppies died for the duration of the first three days.According to helpsleddogs.org, “From the Sled Dog Action Coalition: At least 154 dogs have died in the Iditarod. There is no official count of dog deaths available for the race’s early years” {https://helpsleddogs.org} No pinnacle groups have ever misplaced a dog, and the most desirable overall performance with the aid of a dogsled group reflects the finest daily care on the trail. The Iditarod has improved obligatory relaxation stops, the quantity of canine meals at race checkpoints, and the authority of race veterinarians and officers to defend dogs. You have now learned that the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race is 1,100 miles (1,770 km) long, the Iditarod runs alongside the Yukon River for a hundred and fifty miles (241 km), the route size and route fluctuate barely from year to year, and the center 0.33 takes alternate routes in extraordinary and even years, and in 2015, due to lack of snow south of the Alaska Range, the aggressive beginning factor used to be moved north to Fairbanks. -BrennanLM'
  "They covered the precious mahogany coffin with a brown amalgam of rocks, decomposed organisms, and weeds. It was my turn to take the shovel, but I felt too ashamed to dutifully send her off when I had not properly said goodbye. I refused to throw dirt on her. I refused to let go of my grandmother, to accept a death I had not seen coming, to believe that an illness could not only interrupt, but steal a beloved life. When my parents finally revealed to me that my grandmother had been battling liver cancer, I was twelve and I was angry--mostly with myself. They had wanted to protect me--only six years old at the time--from the complex and morose concept of death. However, when the end inevitably arrived, I wasn’t trying to comprehend what dying was; I was trying to understand how I had been able to abandon my sick grandmother in favor of playing with friends and watching TV. Hurt that my parents had deceived me and resentful of my own oblivion, I committed myself to preventing such blindness from resurfacing. I became desperately devoted to my education because I saw knowledge as the key to freeing myself from the chains of ignorance. While learning about cancer in school I promised myself that I would memorize every fact and absorb every detail in textbooks and online medical journals. And as I began to consider my future, I realized that what I learned in school would allow me to silence that which had silenced my grandmother. However, I was focused not with learning itself, but with good grades and high test scores. I started to believe that academic perfection would be the only way to redeem myself in her eyes--to make up for what I had not done as a granddaughter. However, a simple walk on a hiking trail behind my house made me open my own eyes to the truth. Over the years, everything--even honoring my grandmother--had become second to school and grades. As my shoes humbly tapped against the Earth, the towering trees blackened by the forest fire a few years ago, the faintly colorful pebbles embedded in the sidewalk, and the wispy white clouds hanging in the sky reminded me of my small though nonetheless significant part in a larger whole that is humankind and this Earth. Before I could resolve my guilt, I had to broaden my perspective of the world as well as my responsibilities to my fellow humans. Volunteering at a cancer treatment center has helped me discover my path. When I see patients trapped in not only the hospital but also a moment in time by their diseases, I talk to them. For six hours a day, three times a week, Ivana is surrounded by IV stands, empty walls, and busy nurses that quietly yet constantly remind her of her breast cancer. Her face is pale and tired, yet kind--not unlike my grandmother’s. I need only to smile and say hello to see her brighten up as life returns to her face. Upon our first meeting, she opened up about her two sons, her hometown, and her knitting group--no mention of her disease. Without even standing up, the three of us—Ivana, me, and my grandmother--had taken a walk together. Cancer, as powerful and invincible as it may seem, is a mere fraction of a person’s life. It’s easy to forget when one’s mind and body are so weak and vulnerable. I want to be there as an oncologist to remind them to take a walk once in a while, to remember that there’s so much more to life than a disease. While I physically treat their cancer, I want to lend patients emotional support and mental strength to escape the interruption and continue living. Through my work, I can accept the shovel without burying my grandmother’s memory."

We don't have the typical  I hate you, don't talk to me  siblinghood (although occasionally it would be nice to get away from him); we're each other's best friends. Or at least he's mine.  Lol ur not Harry Styles,  upper left corner. Bought in seventh grade and transferred from my old laptop, this sticker is torn but persevering with layers of tape. Despite conveying my fangirl-y infatuation with Harry Styles' boyband, One Direction, for me Styles embodies an artist-activist who uses his privilege for the betterment of society. As a $42K donor to the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, a hair donor to the Little Princess Trust, and promoter of LGBTQ+ equality, he has motivated me to be a more public activist instead of internalizing my beliefs.  Catapult,  middle right. This is the logo of a startup incubator where I launched my first company, Threading Twine. I learned that business can provide others access to fundamental human needs, such as economic empowerment of minorities and education. In my career, I hope to be a corporate advocate for the empowerment of women, creating large-scale impact and deconstructing institutional boundaries that obstruct women from working in high-level positions. Working as a women's rights activist will allow me to engage in creating lasting movements for equality, rather than contributing to a cycle that elevates the stances of wealthy individuals.  Thank God it's Monday,  sneakily nestled in the upper right corner. Although I attempt to love all my stickers equally (haha), this is one of my favorites. I always want my association with work to be positive. And there are many others, including the horizontal, yellow stripes of the Human Rights Campaign;  The Team,  a sticker from the Model G20 Economics Summit where I collaborated with youth from around the globe; and stickers from  Kode with Klossy,  a community of girls working to promote women's involvement in underrepresented fields. When my computer dies (hopefully not for another few years), it will be like my passport expiring. It'll be difficult leaving these moments and memories behind, but I probably won't want these stickers in my 20s anyways (except Harry Styles, that's never leaving). My next set of stickers will reveal my next set of aspirations. They hold the key to future paths I will navigate, knowledge I will gain, and connections I will make."
  "I am on Oxford Academy’s Speech and Debate Team, in both the Parliamentary Debate division and the Lincoln-Douglass debate division. I write screenplays, short stories, and opinionated blogs and am a regular contributor to my school literary magazine, The Gluestick. I have accumulated over 300 community service hours that includes work at homeless shelters, libraries, and special education youth camps. I have been evaluated by the College Board and have placed within the top percentile. But I am not any of these things. I am not a test score, nor a debater, nor a writer. I am an anti-nihilist punk rockphilosopher. And I became so when I realized three things: 1) That the world is ruled by underwear. There is a variety of underwear for a variety of people. You have your ironed briefs for your businessmen, your soft cottons for the average, and hemp-based underwear for your environmental romantics. But underwear do not only tell us about who we are, they also influence our daily interactions in ways most of us don't even understand. For example, I have a specific pair of underwear that is holey, worn out but surprisingly comfortable. And despite how trivial underwear might be, when I am wearing my favorite pair, I feel as if I am on top of the world. In any case, these articles of clothing affect our being and are the unsung heroes of comfort. 2) When I realized I cannot understand the world. I recently debated at the Orange County Speech League Tournament, within the Parliamentary Division. This specific branch of debate is an hour long, and consists of two parties debating either side of a current political issue. In one particular debate, I was assigned the topic: Should Nation States eliminate nuclear arms? It so happened that I was on the negative side and it was my job to convince the judges that countries should continue manufacturing nuclear weapons. During the debate, something strange happened: I realized that we are a special breed of species, that so much effort and resources are invested to ensure mutual destruction. And I felt that this debate in a small college classroom had elucidated something much more profound about the scale of human existence. In any case, I won 1st place at the tournament, but as the crowd cheered when my name was called to stand before an audience of hundreds of other debaters, and I flashed a victorious smile at the cameras, I couldn’t help but imagine that somewhere at that moment a nuclear bomb was being manufactured, adding to an ever-growing stockpile of doom. And that's when I realized that the world was something I will never understand. 3) When I realized I was a punk rocker philosopher. One summer night, my friend took me to an underground hardcore punk rock show. It was inside a small abandoned church. After the show, I met and became a part of this small community. Many were lost and on a constant soul-search, and to my surprise, many, like myself, did not have a blue Mohawk or a nose piercing. Many were just ordinary people discussing Nietzsche, string theory, and governmental ideologies. Many were also artists creating promotional posters and inventive slogans for stickers. They were all people my age who could not afford to be part of a record label and did something extraordinary by playing in these abandoned churches, making their own CDs and making thousands of promotional buttons by hand. I realized then that punk rock is not about music nor is it a guy with a blue Mohawk screaming protests. Punk rock is an attitude, a mindset, and very much a culture. It is an antagonist to the conventional. It means making the best with what you have to contribute to a community. This was when I realized that I was a punk rock philosopher. The world I come from consists of underwear, nuclear bombs, and punk rockers. And I love this world. My world is inherently complex, mysterious, and anti-nihilist. I am David Phan, somebody who spends his weekends debating in a three piece suit, other days immersed within the punk rock culture, and some days writing opinionated blogs about underwear. But why college? I want a higher education. I want more than just the textbook fed classrooms in high school. A community which prizes revolutionary ideals, a sharing of multi-dynamical perspectives, an environment that ultimately acts as a medium for movement, similar to the punk rock community. I do not see college as a mere stepping stone for a stable career or a prosperous life, but as a supplement for knowledge and self-empowerment; it is a social engine that will jettison us to our next paradigm shift."
  "Well, here goes nothing. I decided to do this assignment while waiting for class. I arrived at 3, class starts at 3:30,my bad. Guess I'll just transfer it to computer later. This hallway isn't particularly quiet. The door next to me squeaks. Not like a mouse mind you, but that annoying oil-me-sound. This hallway looks different than all the others. I don't know why that is exactly, it just does. I don't seem to be having that many creative thoughts. My suite-mate told me that you become most creative during the late hours like 2 and 3a. m. I guess this is my creative down-time. Boy, I could sure use a little down-time. Too many things still left to do. Somewhere in here I have to eat dinner. I refuse to eat from the death carts again today. Granted, they do have good eggrolls. But I just don't want figure out what the meat is. Dog would be very bad. I've got a dog, or at least I had a dog. I had to leave him at home. I guess I'll see him at Christmas. I like it how the semester ends at Christmas. Less to worry about over the holidays. Unlike high school. I hated it when teachers would have tests right after long vacations. Not that I did bad on them. It just meant I had to think about the upcoming test for the duration of break. Y'know, it's going to be hard to type all this one-handed. I fractured my finger about a week before class. For the time being my finger is immobilized. You'd be surprised at all the times we use our pinky and take it for granted. It is a very essential finger. Only 5 more weeks or so, and it will be healed. Personally, I can't wait. I've really had an interesting time as a new student. Adapt to college and adapt to the loss of complete hand movement. Which is essentially the loss of my left hand. I wonder how long this is typed. It's 2 pages written. OUCH#@** My leg is asleep. Pins & needles are always a fun sensation. I wonder how much longer it will be till class. Almost there I think. I feel good that I actually completed a paper weeks before the deadline. It's not a first, but it's close. I've decided one thing about UT, TEX hates me. He asked me if I wanted him to search for one of my classes, and of course I said yes. So TEX replied that my class had been added from 7-9. No problem, right?  He neglected to mention p. m. I am no longer enrolled in anthropology. GOOD-BYE AND GOOD LUCK."
